# Step 2: Pick your losses #imo
```ad-important
- What do I need to sacrafice in order for this goal to be achieved with the time that I got? 
	- It could be another goal, could be attributes, could be anything
- It doesn't have to be just losses, think of a thing that you need to cut out of your life to achieve another thing
- Expect the lost and accept the lost
- Alaways think about your losses, not just in this section, not just in this note, but as a pillar of your life
```
- Relatives time, aka watch movies together with my cousins in cinema or have fun on the weekend with them.
- Friends time, including going outside to hang out with them, play games with them online. I will only go with them if there's a dedicated, planned vacation on a specific occasion (Celebrating one's achievement, on holiday)
- If I don't get enough income to be the same or 10% lower as my previous job for the next 2 months, I have to get a 9 - 5 job to support myself

# Step 3: Dissect the goal
```ad-question
- What do you need in order to achieve this goal? (knowledge, skills, attributes, resources)?
- When the attribute you want to build stagnate:
	- Is there any other attribute you might not think of before?
	- Is there any attribute that you know you should improve, but you didn't?
```
## **Physical health**
- Have a strong foundation and advanced knowledge and techniques
	- [[Foundation|Foundation]]
- Be able to use it or recall to it when needed (Decoding)

	- etc.
- Reflect on gym session(s) for the day/ week/ month depending on your knowledge and technique competency
	- E.g. If you're just starting out and don't know much about how to lift correctly, you might need to reflect a lot about it after trying out new technique
- Critical thinking: To find resources that is science-based
- Eating schedule to accommodate my fitness health

## Planning %% fold %%
- After watching [Goal Setting Is a Hamster Wheel. Learn to Set Systems Instead. | Adam Alter | Big Think - YouTube](https://youtu.be/x44zEK39GOM), I realized that I've beaten myself up time and time again to reach a goal, only ended up realizing is unfathomable to reach, and quit it. I really need a good system to get stuff done.
	- Even though Marginal Gains and 30-day plan have to set goals, I feel like it justifiable, since you need to think about what the person that is likely to achieve that goal have, list out all factors and compare your factors to that ideal factors, and then working your way up. The goal is always on the top of every MGs and 30-day plan, but the factors to get there are the most important 
=> Daily planning is enough, for now
